# HTML

Common markup patterns I use for developing websites.

# Features

* All non-media elements in the HTML5 spec are included on one page and are ready to be styled.
* Modular Structure - add your own patterns, or delete the ones you don't like.
* Semantic and accessible markup examples for common design patterns.
* Thoroughly commented code (notes and reference links for new HTML developers)

# Getting the Code

* Create a new repo for your project on Github
* In terminal run
```bash
    git clone git@github.com:mrmrs/html.git yourNewRepoName
    cd [yourNewRepoName]
    git remote rm origin
    git remote add origin git@github.com:yourUserName/yourNewRepoName.git
    git remote -v
```

* git remote -v will allow you to check that you have changed the remote origin correctly. The output should look like:
```bash
    origin git@github.com:yourUserName/yourNewRepoName.git (fetch)
    origin git@github.com:yourUserName/yourNewRepoName.git (push)
```

Now you're set up to use this in a new project.
### Basic Steps for Full Stack Web Developer:

1. Learn Basic of:
   - HTML
   - CSS
   - JavaScript
2. Develop Simple Project using these technologies to understand how does the website actually work.
3. Choose any 1 Front-End Technology:
   - React JS
   - Vue JS
   - Angular
4. Along with Front-End we need to study Back-End also:
   - Java
   - Python
   - C#
   - Ruby
   - Php
   - Node JS
5. We need databases to store the data:

- SQL
  - MYSQL
  - SQL Server
  - Oracle
  - Postegre SQL
- NOSQL
  - MongoDB
  - Casssandra
  - CouchDB

6. Then we have different versions of the developed software with some changes, so we use:
   - Git
   - GitHub/GitLab/BitBucket
7. Finally we need one of the Cloud Services to host the website:
   - Google Cloud Platform
   - Microsoft Azure
   - Amazon Web Service
   - Heroku
8. Some containers used in Cloud Services:
   - Docker
   - Kubernetes

## Once we prepare all these aspect for a particular project we can get a hang of Full Stack Web Development.

# Getting Started

## The HTML
* Open up index.html with your favorite text editor and hack away. It's that simple.
* To preview changes at http://localhost:8000 - open up terminal.app and type
```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```
